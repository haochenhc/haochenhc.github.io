I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.uic.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Chicago](https://www.uic.edu/), and a core member of the UIC [Center for Bioinformatics and Quantitative Biology](https://cbqb.uic.edu/) (CBQB). I also hold an affiliate faculty position at UIC [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.uic.edu/). I currently serve as an Associate Editor for the [IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tcbb).

Before joining UIC, I completed my postdoctoral research in the Ray and Stephanie Lane Computational Biology Department at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), working with Professor [Ziv Bar-Joseph](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zivbj/). I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at the [University of California, Riverside](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/), where I was supervised by Professor [Tao Jiang](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jiang/). I also spent several summers at [Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research](https://www.linkedin.com/company/novartis/) and [Google](https://www.linkedin.com/company/google/) during my PhD.

My research lies at the intersection of computational biology and AI/machine learning, with a focus on developing data-driven approaches to explore biological systems. By combining machine learning with single-cell and spatial omics data, my goal is to uncover the dynamics of gene regulation in cellular fates and the mechanisms of cellular responses to stimuli, with implications in drug discovery and disease modeling. I am also actively working on deep learning approaches for drug discovery, as well as genome and protein sequence modeling.
