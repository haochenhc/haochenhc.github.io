I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computational Science at the University of Illinois Chicago.

Prior to that, I completed my postdoctoral research in the [Ray and Stephanie Lane Computational Biology Department]() of [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), working with Professors [Ziv Bar-Joseph](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zivbj/) and [Jose Lugo-Martinez](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/jlugomar/). I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at the [University of California, Riverside](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/), where I was supervised by Professor [Tao Jiang](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jiang/).

My research interests lie broadly in computational biology and bioinformatics. Currently, my research focuses on the development of machine learning methods using large-scale single-cell and spatial omics data to study the programs of cellular organization, communication, and differentiation, and their impact on tissue development, health, and disease. I also worked on drug discovery and biological sequence modeling for learning isoform functions and alternative splicing.

During my PhD, I was a research intern with [Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research](https://www.linkedin.com/company/novartis/), where I worked on gene signature representation for drug discovery. I also interned at [Google](https://www.linkedin.com/company/google/), working on deep learning topics.

<span style="color: red;">I am moving to University of Illinois Chicago as an Assistant Professor in October 2024. I am looking for self-motivated PhD students (Fall 2025). Feel free to contact if you are interested to join!</span>
