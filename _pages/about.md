I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago, and a core member of the UIC Center for Bioinformatics and Quantitative Biology (CBQB).

Prior to that, I completed my postdoctoral research in the [Ray and Stephanie Lane Computational Biology Department]() of [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), working with Professors [Ziv Bar-Joseph](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zivbj/) and [Jose Lugo-Martinez](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/jlugomar/). I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at the [University of California, Riverside](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/), where I was supervised by Professor [Tao Jiang](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jiang/).

My research interests lie broadly in computational biology and bioinformatics. Currently, my research focuses on the development of machine learning methods using large-scale single-cell and spatial omics data to study the programs of cellular organization, communication, and differentiation, and their impact on tissue development, health, and disease. I also worked on drug discovery and biological sequence modeling for learning isoform functions and alternative splicing.

During my PhD, I was a research intern with [Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research](https://www.linkedin.com/company/novartis/), where I worked on gene signature representation for drug discovery. I also interned at [Google](https://www.linkedin.com/company/google/), working on deep learning topics.

<span style="color: red;"><b>New!</b> I am looking for motivated PhD students starting from Spring/Fall 2025. If you're interested in joining my lab, please reach out! Current UIC undergraduate and masterâ€™s students with an interest in research are also encouraged to contact me.</span>
